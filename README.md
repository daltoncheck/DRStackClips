# DRStackClips
This script lets you select a clip in the media pool, then places all clips with the same duration in the current timeline, stacked on top of each other.

This is meant to solve the issue where when trying to bring a bunch of audio stems into a timeline, DaVinci defaults to inserting them one after another, when you really just want to put them all on individual tracks.
